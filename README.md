## Quick Start with Docker (Web UI)

**The easiest way to run the web application:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url> # Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL
   cd Substack-Analysis
   ```

2. **Get Your Gemini API Key:**
   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) to generate an API key
   - Ensure your Google Cloud Project has **"Generative Language API"** and **"Vertex AI API"** enabled
   - Make sure billing is enabled for your project

3. **Set Up Your API Key:**
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env and add your actual API key
   # GEMINI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
   ```

4. **Run with Docker:**
   ```bash
   # Make sure Docker is running, then simply run:
   ./run-docker.sh
   ```
   
   Or manually with docker-compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

5. **Open Your Browser:**
   Go to `http://localhost:8501` and start analyzing!

**To stop the application:**
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## MCP Server for Claude Desktop

You can also use this analyzer directly in Claude Desktop as an MCP server!

### Quick Setup (Recommended):

Just run:
```bash
npx substack-analyzer-mcp
```

The interactive setup will guide you through everything!

### Manual Setup:

If you prefer to set it up manually:

1. **Install MCP Server Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd mcp-server
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Claude Desktop:**
   Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "substack-analyzer": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/path/to/Substack-Analysis/mcp-server/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your-gemini-api-key",
           "SUBSTACK_URL": "https://jonathanpolitzki.substack.com/"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop**

Now you can ask Claude to:
- "Fetch my Substack posts"
- "Analyze my writing and give me a summary"
- "What have I written about AI?"

See the [MCP Server README](mcp-server/README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Manual Setup Instructions

If you prefer to run without Docker:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url> # Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL
    cd Substack-Analysis
    ```

2.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    This isolates project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
    # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    *If you don't see `(venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt, the virtual environment is not active.*

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Make sure your virtual environment is active, then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up Your Gemini API Key:**
    You need a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio.
    *   Go to [Google AI Studio (makersuite.google.com)](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) to generate an API key.
    *   Ensure your Google Cloud Project associated with the API key has the **"Generative Language API"** and **"Vertex AI API"** enabled.
    *   Verify that billing is enabled for the project to use models like Gemini 1.5/2.5 Pro beyond very limited free tier quotas.

    Next, create a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory (`Substack-Analysis/.env`). Add your API key to this file like so:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your-actual-api-key-here"
    ```
    Replace `"your-actual-api-key-here"` with the API key you obtained.
    *Alternatively, you can set it as a system environment variable, e.g., `export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-actual-api-key-here"` on macOS/Linux.*

## How to Run the Application

### With Docker (Recommended)
```bash
./run-docker.sh
```
Then open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

### Manual Run
1.  **Activate Virtual Environment (if you created one):**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Run the Streamlit App:**
    From the project's root directory (`Substack-Analysis`), execute:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Or, if the `streamlit` command isn't found directly (due to PATH issues):
    ```bash
    python3 -m streamlit run app.py
    ```
    This will start a local web server, and the application should open automatically in your web browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).

## Using the Application

1.  **Configuration (Sidebar):**
    *   **Enter your Gemini API Key**: If you haven't used a `.env` file, you can paste your API key here. The app will confirm if the key allows for analyzer initialization.
    *   **Your Substack URL**: Enter the main URL of your Substack (e.g., `https://yourname.substack.com/`).

2.  **Fetch Posts:**
    *   Click the "Fetch Posts" button in the sidebar. The app will scrape the latest posts from your Substack's RSS feed.
    *   A list of fetched post titles and dates will appear, and you can expand it to view them.

3.  **Analyze Your Essays (Requires a valid API Key):**
    *   **Overall Writing Summary & Analysis**: Click "Generate Overall Summary". Gemini will read through all fetched essays and provide a comprehensive analysis. This may take a few moments.
    *   **Ask Questions About Your Essays**: Type any question about your essays into the text area (e.g., "What are my main arguments about technology?", "Summarize my post titled 'Reflections on X'"). Click "Ask Gemini". The AI will answer based on the content of *all* fetched essays.

## Output

-   The analysis and Q&A results are displayed directly in the web application.
-   Currently, fetched posts and analysis results are not saved to disk by the Streamlit app (this was a feature of the `main.py` script). This can be added if desired.

## Important Notes & Limitations

-   **RSS Feed Limit**: Substack RSS feeds typically only provide the ~20 most recent posts. The application currently relies on this feed. To analyze your entire archive, you would need to explore methods like manual export from your Substack dashboard and adapt the tool to read that data.
-   **Gemini API Quotas**: While `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06` supports a very long context, be mindful of API usage costs and potential rate limits depending on your Google Cloud/AI Studio account tier. Ensure your project has billing enabled for sustained use.
-   **Error Handling**: The application includes basic error handling for API key issues and fetching problems. If you encounter persistent errors, check your API key validity, Google Cloud project settings, and internet connection. The terminal where you ran `streamlit run app.py` will often show more detailed error logs (like the `Illegal header value` errors we troubleshooted).

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

-   **`streamlit: command not found`**:
    *   Ensure your virtual environment is active (`source venv/bin/activate`).
    *   Try running with `python3 -m streamlit run app.py`.
    *   If it persists, ensure Streamlit was installed correctly (`pip install streamlit`).
-   **Gemini API Errors (e.g., 429 Quota Exceeded, Authentication Errors, Illegal Header Value):**
    *   Verify your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is correct in the `.env` file or sidebar.
    *   Confirm "Generative Language API" and "Vertex AI API" are enabled in your Google Cloud Project.
    *   Ensure your Google Cloud Project has billing enabled and is in good standing.
    *   Check for any restrictions on your API key in the Google Cloud Console.
    *   Allow a few minutes after creating/modifying an API key or enabling services for changes to propagate.
-   **No Posts Fetched**:
    *   Double-check the Substack URL for typos.
    *   Ensure the Substack is public and its RSS feed is accessible.
